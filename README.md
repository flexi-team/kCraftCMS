kCraft CMS - Build on top of the cutting edge technology such as Laravel, Bootstrap and AngularJs

#Specs
What we are trying to achieve first is to port from our exising project template (Silver Craft) to a fully functional CMS. But this will turn out to be a long run project. So we will define our initial steps to kick off the project with confidence:
- Editable content template
- Structure dom, class and css
- Support custom layout, embeddable part, custom css
- Drag and drop support for content part, editing content part, adding custom or third party content part.
- Support multiple layout or theme
